# 📦 Vendor Invoice Intelligence Portal

An AI-powered analytics system for predicting freight costs and detecting risky vendor invoices using Machine Learning.

---

# 🚀 Project Overview

The Vendor Invoice Intelligence Portal helps finance and procurement teams:

- Predict freight costs accurately
- Detect abnormal or risky invoices
- Reduce manual approval workload
- Improve operational efficiency
- Support vendor negotiation and budgeting

The system combines:
- Regression models for freight cost prediction
- Classification models for invoice risk flagging
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time predictions

---

# 🧠 Machine Learning Objectives

## 1. Freight Cost Prediction
Predict expected freight cost using invoice-related features such as:
- Quantity
- Invoice Dollars

### Model Type
Regression

### Goal
Improve:
- Budget forecasting
- Freight estimation
- Cost optimization

---

## 2. Invoice Risk Flag Prediction
Predict whether an invoice should be flagged for manual approval.

### Model Type
Classification

### Goal
Detect:
- Abnormal invoice values
- Freight inconsistencies
- Delayed receiving patterns
